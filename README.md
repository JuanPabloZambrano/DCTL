# DCTLS
These are DCTLs that I have developed.

# Installation
DCTLs should be placed in the following folder:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/LUT`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\LUT`

Fuses should be placed in the following folder to install them into the Fusion page of DaVinci Resolve:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Fusion/Fuses`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Fuses`

Fuses should also be placed in the following folder to install them for Fusion Studio:

**MacOS**: `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/Fusion/Fuses`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\Fusion\Fuses`

If a DCTL is not working, you can usually find logs in these directories. If you find that there is a problem, make an Issue on Github with your OS and Resolve version so I can fix it.

**MacOS**: `[Your user directory]/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/logs/davinci_resolve.log` or `/Library/Application Support/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/logs/davinci_resolve.log`

**Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\logs\davinci_resolve.log` or `[Your user directory]\AppData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\logs\davinci_resolve.log`
